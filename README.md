# ICS3U-Final-Project

This was my ICS3U project, and it took a month to develop by myself. It's a recreation of the popular arcade game "Snake". Using the arrow keys, you control a snake around a 20 x 20 game grid. Strawberries will periodically spawn on the grid, and as you eat more strawberries, the higher your score gets. However, the length of the snake also increases. You lose the round when you crash into yourself or hit a wall.

# Code Style
The structure of the written code and Javadoc comments are based off of Richmond Hill High School's [Java Style Programming Guide](https://github.com/danielrzhang/ICS4U1-Computer-Science/blob/main/RHHS%20Java%20Style%20Guide.pdf).

# Notes
We briefly (and I really mean very *very* briefly) went over Swing GUI in Java at school, so some of the graphics code might not make sense. The structure of the code is also really bad, because I really didn't understand how OOP worked and I never designed a game in my life before. If you want a better example, go look at my [ICS4U1 Tank Game](https://github.com/danielrzhang/ICS4U1-Final-Project) instead, which has better OOP design and code structure.
