# Hungry Snake
Hungry Snake is an engaging recreation of the beloved arcade classic "Snake". In this game, you take control of a snake within a 20 x 20 game grid. Utilizing the arrow keys, navigate the snake around the grid, maneuvering it towards strawberries that periodically spawn. Each time your snake consumes a strawberry, your score increases, and your snake grows longer.

However, be careful! The longer your snake becomes, the more challenging it becomes to avoid self-collision and collisions with the walls of the game grid. A single misstep can end your game, so strategize your movements wisely to achieve the highest score possible.

# How to Play
 - Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to navigate your snake.
 - Guide your snake towards strawberries to consume them and increase your score.
 - Avoid colliding with the snake's own body or the walls of the game grid.
 - The game ends when your snake collides with itself or hits a wall.
